# InsuranceCost-Prediction.-evaluating-model-between-SLR-MLR-and-Polynomial Regression
An end-to-end machine learning application to predict medical insurance costs. The project involved an iterative modeling process, culminating in a Polynomial Regression model that achieved 85% R-squared accuracy by capturing the complex, non-linear relationships in personal attribute data.
